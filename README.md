# Onyx Digital Intelligence Development

Onyx Digital Intelligence Development builds system software and tools for Linux environments with an emphasis on predictable behavior, readable configuration, and long-term support. Most work is centered around Nix, Rust, and practical system design.

This organization hosts the codebases for OnyxOSV, Alopex, Exom, Vacuum Launcher, and related modules.

## Projects

OnyxOSV  
A NixOS-based operating system designed around clear module boundaries, reproducible builds, and a reliable installation path. Built for consistency and operational stability rather than rapid visual changes.

Alopex  
A Rust-based network management system intended as a more maintainable alternative to NetworkManager. Handles Ethernet, Wi-Fi, VPN, and Bluetooth with a focus on clean integration and predictable behavior.

Exom  
A native collaborative environment for developers. Focuses on creating a structured workspace rather than replicating web platforms.

Vacuum Launcher  
A system control application built with Rust and Iced. Provides a consistent entry point for system actions, status, and integration with Alopex and system modules.

OSV Modules  
Reusable NixOS modules used across the OnyxOSV ecosystem. Kept separate for clarity and maintainability.

## Philosophy

The work in this organization follows a few core ideas:

- Tools should be predictable and easy to understand.
- Configuration should be explicit, not magical.
- Software should prefer maintainability over novelty.
- Native applications should feel consistent across the system.
- Nix flakes, Rust modules, and structured directories serve clarity, not hype.
